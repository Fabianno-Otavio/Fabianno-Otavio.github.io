<h3 align="justify">
  This is my first project in HTML and CSS, I started it with the Marco Bruno's course on YouTube. He stated with a Figma design in which I have changed my way.
  Over this couse I've learned from nothing on HTML and CSS to where I am now, always applying all that I learn, in this and other courses, including some JavaScript, which
  I've started learning in this course and deepened in other courses.
